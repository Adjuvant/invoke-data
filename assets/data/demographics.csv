","The medium and interface both pose an interesting means for collaboration. Through exploration and understanding of the space and the tasks, there were new ways to attempt to collaborate. During this task, attempted a few different strategies to achieve this: either through shared collaboration in building the trajectory, or remote collaboration, i.e. one person building the trajectory, another person managing the tracks on the UI. ",VR presents a novel medium. Embodiment in space is something that has previously not been utilised much in music production and this presents new possibilities for musicians and engineers. ,"This sort of interface might be useful when mixing a track specifically for spatial audio systems, i.e. if it is being rendered binaurally or using ambisonics. Would be interesting to hear it played back within a physical space. ","Finer control over the trajectory space, making it easier to modify and delete trajectories.

The ability to move full trajectories once they are drawn. The ability to merge between listening positions (I suppose here I'm thinking more about using this as a tool for composing fixed medium acousmatic music rather than as a VR audio authoring tool). ,2,2,2,3,1,3,4,3,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3

Often when making music in a regualr space, you zone out and are focusing on things that are not tangible.   to make the audio a tangeble object to physically play around with, something that has forever been various shapes in my mind, makes it a really exciting prospect. ","Acuracy is the one thing that might be difficult at this stage.  That said, with a bit more time to feel very comfortable in the space, you could argue that you would be able to be much more accurate with spacial audio. It's timing and rythmic automation might be harder to get that accuracy.  ",5,3,5,5,2,5,5,2,5,5,1,2,5,5,5,1,5,5
