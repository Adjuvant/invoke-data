            <h5>Results</h5>
            <p>Figure <a href="#fig:invoke:csisus" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:invoke:csisus">CSI1</a> indicates the overall results from the <span data-acronym-label="csi" data-acronym-form="singular+short">csi</span> and SUS measures,
                showning that creativity was supported more than usability. There was a near significant correlation between <span data-acronym-label="csi" data-acronym-form="singular+short">csi</span> and SUS across participants (Pearson’s r(8) = 0.62,
                p = 0.054). While both represent scores on a 0-100 scale, the two measures should not be considered orthogonal as an assessment of the interface. The specificity of the
                <span data-acronym-label="csi" data-acronym-form="singular+short">csi</span> reflects weighted perceptions based on its factor structure, rather than the broader framing of the SUS. Addressing the overall average (unweighted) responses
                from users (see Figure <a href="#fig:invoke:findings:survey:csi:wafs" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:invoke:findings:survey:csi:wafs">[CSI2]</a>), the two factors with the highest averages were Collaboration (<span class="math inline">$\overline{m}=7.83,\ \sigma=1.68)$</span>)
                and Enjoyment (<span class="math inline">$\overline{m}=8.21,\
                \sigma=1.88$</span>). In particular, the high average score for Enjoyment does not contribute towards the final <span data-acronym-label="csi" data-acronym-form="singular+short">csi</span> rating for many users, as its weighted value tends
                towards the mid-lower range. Observing the differences across users in Figure <a href="#fig:invoke:findings:survey:csi:wafs" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:invoke:findings:survey:csi:wafs">[CSI2]</a>, Exploration and Expressiveness
                are the only two factors to feature in all users WAFS responses. This result indicates individual variation in user perception of their needs when working with sound and music, but also the importance of being able to work on the content
                at hand effectively; exploring ideas with suitable levels of sonic detail and immediacy of control. These results are coherent with feedback in the
                <span data-acronym-label="ta" data-acronym-form="singular+short">Thematic Analysis</span>, where users discussed exploration, immersion, engagement, tool transparency and expressiveness.

            <p>The factors of the AttrakDiff <span class="citation" data-cites="Hassenzahl2004"></span> semantic differentials of product quality use item scales of 1-7. Results indicate high factor values for
                <em>Attractiveness</em> (<span class="math inline">$\overline{m}=5.48,\
                \sigma=1.01$</span>), the <em>Hedonic Quality of Identity</em> (<span class="math inline">$\overline{m}=5.39,\ \sigma=1.18$</span>), and the
                <em>Hedonic Quality of Stimulation</em> (<span class="math inline">$\overline{m}=5.91,\ \sigma=0.88$</span>), but only a moderately positive response to <em>Pragmatic Quality</em> (<span class="math inline">$\overline{m}=4.01,\ \sigma=1.49$</span>).
                The results indicate a predominantly positive attitude towards the
                <em>Invoke</em> system as a tool for spatial audio. In particular, the Hedonic Stimulation items show high mean scores for differentials such as ordinary/novel (<span class="math inline">$\overline{m}=6.25,\
                \sigma=0.75$</span>), conservative/innovative (<span class="math inline">$\overline{m}=6.17,\ \sigma=0.58$</span>), and dull/captivating (<span class="math inline">$\overline{m}=5.83,\
                \sigma=0.83$</span>). Echoing the usability concerns discussed throughout analyses, it can be seen that the system suffers from issues related to confusion, complexity, practicality, and general usability. Despite these usability issues,
                the other more hedonic qualities indicate positive attitudes.</p>

            <p>In addition to other survey data, a series of Likert scales were designed to gather data on a variety of factors. These items and results were not included for brevity. Adapting usability questionnaires, mutual engagement questionnaires, and
                group learning systems, the CoSIQ aims to gather broad feedback using open response and likert items, grouped into factors. </p>

            <p>Unless specified otherwise, Likert ranges are: 0 N/A; 1 I do not agree at all; 2 Do not agree; 3 Neither agree or disagree; 4 Agree; 5 I fully agree. Each group contains a single open response item (<em>in

            <p>Three items within the likert responses showed positive agreement (CQ08_02, CQ08_03, CQ08_04, CQ08_07), suggesting that users’ perceived a level of understanding in sound action and engagement in process. More ambiguous responses were observed
                for the ability to plan and control sound actions with a level of detail (CQ08_05, CQ08_06). Also the level of embodiment of gesture and sound had ambiguous results (CQ08_01).</p>

            <h5 id="sus-calculation">SUS Calculation</h5>
            <p>To calculate the SUS score, first sum the score contributions from each item. Each item’s score contribution will range from 0 to 4. For items 1,3,5,7 and 9, the score contribution is the scale position minus 1. For items 2,4,6,8 and 10, the
                contribution is 5 minus the scale position. Multiply the sum of the scores by 2.5 to obtain the overall value of SUS. SUS scores have a range of 0 to 100, where the higher the value, the higher level of usability.</p>
            <h5 id="results-6">Results</h5>
            <p>Given that a standardized test was used for usability (SUS), the results are summarised in the general system score, fig. <a href="#fig:invoke:csisus" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:invoke:csisus">[fig:invoke:csisus]</a>, individual
                scores can be seen in <a href="#fig:invoke:cq07" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:invoke:cq07">[fig:invoke:cq07]</a>.</p>
